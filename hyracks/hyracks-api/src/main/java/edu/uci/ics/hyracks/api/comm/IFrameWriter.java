/**
 * {@link IFrameWriter} is the interface implemented by a stream consumer. An {@link IFrameWriter} could be in one of the following states:
 * <ul>
 * <li>INITIAL</li>
 * <li>OPENED</li>
 * <li>CLOSED</li>
 * <li>FAILED</li>
 * </ul>
 * A producer follows the following protocol when using an {@link IFrameWriter}.
 * Initially, the {@link IFrameWriter} is in the INITIAL state.
 * The first valid call to an {@link IFrameWriter} is always the {@link IFrameWriter#open()}. This call provides the opportunity for the {@link IFrameWriter} implementation to allocate any resources for its
 * processing. Once this call returns, the {@link IFrameWriter} is in the OPENED
 * state. If an error occurs
 * during the {@link IFrameWriter#open()} call, a {@link HyracksDataException} is thrown and it stays in the INITIAL state.
 * While the {@link IFrameWriter} is in the OPENED state, the producer can call
 * one of:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link IFrameWriter#close()} to give up any resources owned by the {@link IFrameWriter} and enter the CLOSED state.</li>
 * <li> {@link IFrameWriter#nextFrame(ByteBuffer)} to provide data to the {@link IFrameWriter}. The call returns normally on success and the {@link IFrameWriter} remains in the OPENED state. On failure, the call throws a {@link HyracksDataException}, and the {@link IFrameWriter} enters the ERROR state.</li>
 * <li> {@link IFrameWriter#fail()} to indicate that stream is to be aborted. The {@link IFrameWriter} enters the FAILED state.</li>
 * </ul>
 * In the FAILED state, the only call allowed is the {@link IFrameWriter#close()} to move the {@link IFrameWriter} into the CLOSED
 * state and give up all resources.
 * No calls are allowed when the {@link IFrameWriter} is in the CLOSED state.
 * Note: If the call to {@link IFrameWriter#open()} failed, the {@link IFrameWriter#close()} is not called by the producer. So an exceptional
 * return from the {@link IFrameWriter#open()} call must clean up all partially
 * allocated resources.
